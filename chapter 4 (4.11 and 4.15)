	Dividing two integers results in integer division, and
	any fractional part of the calculation will be truncated(lost).
	To fix this problem, i need to put double instead of int. 
	for example 
	
	double x = 1.0 / 3;  instead of int x = 1.0/ 3;
	or
	double x = 1.0 / 3.0;  instead of int x = 1.0 / 3.0;

	a. Else
		System.out.println ( " Age is less than 65");

	b.int total = 0; 
	  int x =1;

	c. while (x <= 100)
		{ total += x;
		++x; }
	d. while (y>0)
		{++y;
		System.out.println(y);}
